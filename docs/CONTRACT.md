# OpenRung RN prototype — architecture contract

This document is the binding contract between the TypeScript shell and the two
native implementations. Every implementer follows it exactly; deviations must be
recorded here.

Reference implementation: the OpenRung repository (the production Android app in
`android/`, the production iOS app in `ios/`). This prototype models its UI and
functionality 1:1 unless noted.

## 1. Division of responsibility

**Native (Kotlin service / Swift NEPacketTunnelProvider extension)** owns the whole
connect path, exactly as in the production apps:
broker relay fetch (connect path), relay selection, TCP reachability, sing-box
(libbox) engine lifecycle, Android NAT punching, TUN + DNS config, internet probe, connection-failure
handling, heartbeat telemetry, VPN permission + background lifecycle, recents
recording, status/log persistence.

**TypeScript (RN shell)** owns everything the production *app processes* own:
all UI, navigation, exit-node map directory (broker fetch, grouped by the
broker-served relay locations — relay IPs are never geolocated client-side),
speed test, language selection, licenses screens.

**Availability over "never leak."** OpenRung is availability-first: keeping the
user reachable matters more than guaranteeing no traffic ever leaves the tunnel.
The only leak protection is sing-box `strict_route` *while the tunnel is up*
(`SingBoxConfiguration`). There is deliberately **no OS-level kill switch** (no
`includeAllNetworks` / on-demand enforcement), so when the tunnel is down — no
relay reachable, a service/extension crash, or between sessions — traffic falls
back to the normal network rather than being blocked. "Connection-failure
handling" above and "report failure if no relay works" elsewhere therefore mean
the connect attempt *reports failure without leaving a half-open or leaky tunnel* —
NOT that the OS blocks traffic while the VPN is down.

## 2. Identifiers

| Thing | Value |
|---|---|
| Android applicationId | `com.openrung.mobile` |
| Android namespace / Kotlin root package | `com.openrung` |
| Android minSdk / compile / target | 26 / 36 / 36 (minSdk raised from RN default 24) |
| iOS app bundle id | `com.openrung.app` |
| iOS extension bundle id | `com.openrung.app.PacketTunnel` |
| iOS app group | `group.com.openrung.app` |
| iOS VPN profile localizedDescription | `OpenRung VPN` |
| iOS deployment target | 16.0 |
| DEVELOPMENT_TEAM | `9VLV9A7KS9` |
| Darwin notification (ext→app) | `com.openrung.app.state-changed` |

The production identifiers (`com.openrung.client`, `group.com.openrung.client`,
`com.openrung.client.state-changed`) are NOT reused so both apps install
side-by-side.

## 3. Native bridge contract (both platforms, identical)

Module name: **`OpenRungVpn`** (classic NativeModule + event emitter; the RN 0.86
bridgeless interop layer handles both).

```ts
// src/native/types.ts — the single source of truth for these types
export type ConnectionStatus =
  | 'disconnected' | 'preparing' | 'connecting'
  | 'connected' | 'disconnecting' | 'failed';

export interface RecentNode {
  countryCode: string;   // ISO 3166-1 alpha-2, uppercase
  label: string;         // "City, Country" or country name
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
}

export interface NativeVpnState {
  status: ConnectionStatus;
  relayLabel: string | null;   // resolved geo label, never a raw IP
  lastError: string | null;
  logLines: string[];          // "[HH:mm:ss] message", newest last, cap 80
  recents: RecentNode[];       // newest first, deduped by countryCode, cap 8
}

export interface NativeIdentity {
  clientId: string;            // stable install UUID (native-persisted)
  sessionId: string | null;    // active telemetry session id, null when idle
}

export interface OpenRungVpnModule {
  /** Ask for OS VPN consent (Android: VpnService.prepare dialog; also requests
   *  POST_NOTIFICATIONS on API 33+. iOS: load-or-create the
   *  NETunnelProviderManager and save it). Resolves true when usable. */
  prepare(): Promise<boolean>;
  /** Start (or switch) the tunnel. targetCountry: ISO alpha-2 or null = broker
   *  picks. Resolves once the native start has been dispatched (NOT when
   *  connected — completion is reported via events). */
  connect(brokerUrl: string, targetCountry: string | null): Promise<void>;
  disconnect(): Promise<void>;
  getState(): Promise<NativeVpnState>;
  getIdentity(): Promise<NativeIdentity>;
}
```

Event: name **`openrungStateChanged`**, payload `NativeVpnState`. Emitted on every
status/log/relay/recents change. TS subscribes via `NativeEventEmitter`.
Android also honors `addListener`/`removeListeners` no-op methods (RN interop).

`src/native/OpenRungVpn.ts` exports the typed module. When
`NativeModules.OpenRungVpn` is missing (Jest, fresh Metro without rebuild) it
falls back to `MockOpenRungVpn` (in `src/native/mock.ts`): a scripted simulator
that walks preparing → connecting → connected with fake log lines, so the UI is
demoable without native builds. Selection is automatic; a `isMock` flag is
exported for the Debug screen to display.

## 4. TypeScript layout

```
src/
  config.ts            # port of AppConfig.kt (same constant names/values)
  theme.ts             # palette + mono font (ios Menlo / android monospace)
  i18n/
    index.tsx          # LanguageProvider, useStrings(), setLanguage(tag), RTL note
    strings/en.ts …    # ported from android res/values*/strings.xml (9 locales;
                       #   picker shows 10 options: System default + 9 languages)
  model/
    relay.ts           # RelayDescriptor (snake_case JSON, optional broker-served
                       #   city/country/country_code/latitude/longitude), isUsable()
    countryGeo.ts      # 51-entry centroid table, verbatim from CountryGeo.kt
    exitNode.ts        # ExitNodeRegion (country+city marker), DirectoryStatus
  net/
    brokerClient.ts    # GET /api/v1/relays?limit=N, candidates(), firstReachable()
    exitNodeDirectory.ts # groups relays by broker-served geo (no client-side GeoIP)
    speedTestClient.ts # warmup 1MB + measure 10MB via /api/v1/speed-test
    telemetryClient.ts # POST /api/v1/telemetry/events (speed-test events only)
  state/
    store.ts           # app store: native slice (mirrored) + directory slice
    useVpnState.ts     # hook wiring native events into the store
  native/
    types.ts, OpenRungVpn.ts, mock.ts
  screens/
    MainScreen.tsx, SettingsScreen.tsx, DebugScreen.tsx,
    LicensesScreen.tsx, LicenseTextScreen.tsx
  components/
    ExitNodeMap.tsx, MapStatusChip.tsx, RecentsSection.tsx,
    SettingPanel.tsx, ConsolePanel.tsx, ScreenHeader.tsx
  licenses/
    notices.ts         # bundled license text (generated from THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md + LICENSE)
App.tsx                # route enum { MAIN, SETTINGS, DEBUG, LICENSES, LICENSE_TEXT },
                       # BackHandler mapping, dark StatusBar, SafeArea handling
```

Store shape (mirrors `OpenRungUiState`):

```ts
interface AppState {
  native: NativeVpnState;                 // mirrored from native
  brokerUrl: string;                      // fixed to config default (not editable)
  directoryStatus: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'loaded' | 'failed';
  availableRegions: ExitNodeRegion[];
  languageTag: string;                    // '' = system, persisted in AsyncStorage
}
```

Derived: `isWorking` = preparing|connecting|disconnecting; `isConnected` = connected.
`refreshDirectory(force?)` reproduces `OpenRungStatusStore.refreshDirectory`
(no-op while loading or after a successful non-empty load unless forced).

Speed test runs only while connected, against `config.TELEMETRY_BROKER_URL`,
and posts `speed_test_completed` / `speed_test_failed` telemetry with the
identity from `getIdentity()` (skipped when `sessionId` is null). RN `fetch`
cannot stream progressively; measure wall time to full body and note TTFB as
headers-arrival time (documented limitation).

## 5. UI fidelity

Terminal-green-on-black, ALL text monospace. Palette (from MainActivity.kt):
screen `#030604`, panel `#07110B`, border dim green `#294F35`, terminal green
`#65F58A`, body `#D8FFE0`, dim text `#7DA989`, relay line `#A5F2B5`, connected
button `#B6F579`, on-green text `#061008`, console error `#FFA0A0`, chip failed
`#FFC0C0`, chip bg `#07110B` @ 80%, FAB `#0D1C12`/`#65F58A`, marker stroke `#04140A`.

Screens replicate the Compose layout exactly (spacing 16/18/20dp, button 58dp
r8, map panel r12 border 1, recents cards 140dp r10, FAB bottom-right 20dp,
footer 12sp centered). Navigation = instant swap on a route enum; hardware back:
DEBUG→SETTINGS, LICENSES→SETTINGS, LICENSE_TEXT→LICENSES, else exit-default.
No spinners anywhere — state is communicated by text, exactly like the original.

Map: `@maplibre/maplibre-react-native`. Same style JSON ("openrung-neon",
demotiles vector source, ocean `#030604`, land `#65F58A` @ 0.12, outline @ 0.85
width 1). Camera fixed: center [116, 18], zoom 2.2, min=max=2.2; rotate/tilt/zoom
gestures disabled, pan allowed. ShapeSource (one feature per region:
`code`/`name`/`count` props) + halo CircleLayer (r18, opacity 0.18) + core
CircleLayer (r6, stroke 2 `#04140A`) + count SymbolLayer (11pt, "Open Sans
Semibold", halo 1.4, offset [0,-1.6]). Tap (hitbox 28) → `connect(code)`.

## 6. Android native

Ported from the production app with packages renamed
`com.openrung.client.*` → `com.openrung.*`; UI/Compose/directory code is NOT
ported (that lives in TS now). Files:

### Cross-platform WSS/CDN fallback contract

This contract applies to both native clients; §7 records the iOS adapter and
lifecycle details. WSS is a per-relay access fallback, not a replacement tunnel
protocol. The existing VLESS/Reality/Vision client remains the authenticated
end-to-end data path. Each platform MUST attempt that relay's normal Reality
address first and MUST NOT request a WSS ticket until the direct attempt has
produced a genuine remote TCP or post-start data-path failure. Configuration
encoding, engine creation or startup, VPN permission, Android socket
protection, network-monitor setup, and other local/platform failures fail the
connection locally; they neither unlock WSS nor count against relay health.

A relay is WSS-eligible only when the signed descriptor says
`node_class=foundation`, `exit_mode=direct`, `public_port=443`, and `transport`
is empty or `direct`, and contains a non-empty `wss_fronts` array. The complete
advertised array MUST already exactly match `wsscore.NormalizeFronts`
(supported protocol version, canonical URL/ID, uniqueness, and ID-sorted
order). Kotlin and Swift never repair, reorder, or independently reimplement
those rules; malformed sets make WSS unavailable. Eligible fronts are attempted
sequentially in their exact signed order.

For each front, the client POSTs `{relay_id, front_id}` to the selected broker
base path plus `/api/v1/wss/tickets`, then the built-in broker fronts in order.
Production broker URLs MUST be HTTPS; only an explicit literal-loopback HTTP
base is accepted as a development allowance. Redirects are rejected, caching is
disabled, and client/session identity headers are sent only as a complete pair.
All broker-front attempts share a 15 s deadline and use at most 5 s each. A 429
or 503 can schedule one additional failover round: `Retry-After` accepts
delta-seconds or HTTP-date, a missing/invalid/zero value uses 10 s, and a large
value is clamped to 30 s; the retry is skipped if that wait would consume the
remaining overall budget. The first broker diagnostic is retained if all
attempts fail; status diagnostics never include a response body. Successful
responses are capped at 64 KiB and require
an opaque ticket of at most 4096 UTF-8 bytes, a future `expires_at`, and a URL
that exactly equals the selected signed front.

The exact descriptor URL and opaque ticket are passed unchanged to
`wsscore.DialClient`; neither is reconstructed, put into another URL, or logged.
Its loopback endpoint is validated and supplied to the existing Reality client.
The shared transport implementation is the tagged Go module
`github.com/openrung/openrung/wsscore v0.2.0`, pinned in
`android/punchbridge/go.mod`; the repository contains only the gomobile adapter,
ticket/lifecycle policy, telemetry, and platform integration. Android constructs
the client with a `SocketProtector`; before the outer CDN socket connects it
delegates to `VpnService.protect(fd)`. A missing callback, exception, panic, or
`false` result fails closed and never calls `connect(2)`. iOS constructs the
same client inside `PacketTunnel` with the platform-native
`NewOpenRungWSSClientForIOS` entry point. iOS has no `VpnService` equivalent, so
that constructor deliberately selects wsscore's nil-protector path.
Both constructors enable wsscore's opt-in CloudFront no-SNI mode. The core
applies it only when the exact signed URL uses a native one-label
`*.cloudfront.net` distribution hostname: ClientHello SNI is omitted, the same
hostname remains in the encrypted HTTP `Host` header, and the certificate is
still verified against that hostname. Custom CloudFront CNAMEs and all other
CDNs retain ordinary URL-derived SNI. No platform layer rewrites the URL,
selects a TLS verification name, or implements this TLS behavior itself. DNS
resolution can still reveal the distribution hostname. An ambiguous no-SNI
handshake failure never retries the same single-use ticket with SNI; the normal
front ladder may continue only with the next signed front and a fresh
front-bound ticket.

The first direct failure is the relay-health event. Ticket, CDN, handshake, and
WSS-path failures emit transport-only telemetry (`transport_failed` with
`transport=wss`, front ID, and stage) and MUST NOT add another relay penalty.
Once connected, native WSS adapter loss, the end-to-end path-health failure
threshold, or a changed physical-network fingerprint retires the session.
Android treats route/interface/DNS changes as a new epoch. On iOS, the first
`NWPath` fingerprint establishes a baseline and only a later, different
fingerprint is an epoch change; repeated identical callbacks are ignored.
Extension wake resumes the Reality engine but is not itself an epoch change and
MUST NOT retire a healthy WSS session or mint a ticket. An unexpected local
Reality-engine exit is instead terminal: it never triggers reladdering, ticket
acquisition, or WSS recovery.
Cleanup clears ownership before close and always stops the Reality engine before
the native WSS adapter. Recovery waits for a usable physical network, fetches
fresh signed relay data, and starts again at direct Reality; single-use tickets
and the prior WSS preference are never reused across network epochs.

iOS startup and active-health classification MUST probe over
`NEPacketTunnelProvider.createTCPConnectionThroughTunnel` with TLS, bounded
request time, and a bounded HTTP response head. A `URLSession` created by the
packet-tunnel provider bypasses that provider's TUN and therefore MUST NOT be
used as evidence that Reality or WSS carried end-to-end traffic.

- `vpn/OpenRungVpnService.kt`, `vpn/ProxyEngine.kt` — connect flow including
  Android NAT-punch-first/RelayHub and direct-first WSS/CDN fallback,
  connection-failure handling,
  notification id 2001 channel `openrung_vpn`, heartbeat 50–70s.
- `net/` BrokerClient, GeoIpClient, InternetProbe, RelayReachability,
  SingBoxConfiguration, NatPunchClient, WssTicketClient, WssClient,
  PhysicalNetworkEpochMonitor; `model/` RelayDescriptor, RelaySelector, CountryGeo,
  RecentNode; `telemetry/` all four files (since diverged: `application_connection`
  events are aggregated client-side by the added `ApplicationConnectionAggregator.kt`,
  and the schema dropped destination ip/port/protocol); `config/AppConfig.kt`.
- `state/ConnectionStatus.kt`, `state/OpenRungStatusStore.kt` — trimmed: drop
  directory fields/refresh (TS owns), keep status/relay/error/logs/recents +
  SharedPreferences persistence (`openrung_status`).
- `bridge/OpenRungVpnModule.kt` + `bridge/OpenRungVpnPackage.kt` — implements §3.
  Collects `OpenRungStatusStore.uiState`, maps to a WritableMap, emits events.
  `prepare()` uses VpnService.prepare + ActivityEventListener (request code 7001)
  and POST_NOTIFICATIONS via PermissionAwareActivity on API 33+.
- Manifest: INTERNET, ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE, FOREGROUND_SERVICE,
  FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE, POST_NOTIFICATIONS; service
  `.vpn.OpenRungVpnService` with BIND_VPN_SERVICE + specialUse;
  `networkSecurityConfig=@xml/network_security_config` — cleartext HTTP denied for
  all hosts (discovery, telemetry, geo and probes are all HTTPS; see ARCHITECTURE.md
  § "Network transport").
- Gradle: serialization plugin (Kotlin 2.1.20), kotlinx-serialization-json 1.7.3,
  kotlinx-coroutines-android 1.9.0, conditional `implementation(files("libs/libbox.aar"))`
  (file is copied locally, git-ignored). Status strings the service logs live in
  `res/values*/strings.xml` (ported subset, all 10 locales).
- `android/punchbridge/` (the gomobile `binding.go` plus its sagernet-QUIC
  session/transport/bridge layer, tests excluded) is copied into sing-box's
  temporary `experimental/libbox` tree by `build-libbox-release.sh`, so punch
  and libbox share one gomobile runtime/AAR. The shared punch protocol core is
  not copied: it is resolved as the `github.com/openrung/openrung/punchcore`
  Go module at the version pinned in `android/punchbridge/go.mod`, which the
  script injects into the grafted sing-box `go.mod` via
  `go get github.com/openrung/openrung/punchcore@<pinned version>`
  (`PUNCHCORE_SRC` swaps in a local-checkout `replace` for development only —
  never for releases). The Go UDP fd must be accepted by
  `VpnService.protect` before discovery begins; failure falls back to RelayHub.
- The same combined AAR grafts `wss_binding.go`, but resolves all WebSocket,
  TLS, yamux, transport-bound, and loopback-adapter code from the exact wsscore
  version in `android/punchbridge/go.mod`. `WSSCORE_SRC` is a local-development
  replace only and MUST NOT be used for a release artifact.
- The signed descriptor must advertise an explicit HTTPS punch endpoint. Bare-IP
  self-signed coordinators are accepted only when their exact certificate SHA-256
  appears in `AppConfig.PUNCH_COORDINATOR_CERT_SHA256_BY_HOST`; hostname endpoints
  use normal public-CA validation. Redirects and cleartext are always rejected.
- After a direct connection reaches CONNECTED, Android races native QUIC closure
  against a jittered end-to-end health monitor. Three failed tunnel sweeps plus a
  successful physical-network broker probe trigger fresh discovery/re-punch and
  RelayHub fallback. Native path loss waits for a reachable physical network, so
  a local outage leaves the foreground service CONNECTING instead of failing it.
- A transport-independent engine monitor watches libbox during direct, punched,
  and WSS sessions. Unexpected engine exit is a terminal local failure and never
  starts reladdering or ticket acquisition. WSS network, adapter, and end-to-end
  path-health recovery cancels that monitor, stops the engine first, closes the
  physical-network epoch monitor, and then closes the WSS adapter. It waits for
  a usable physical network before fresh signed discovery and a direct-first
  attempt with a fresh ticket only if another eligible remote failure occurs.
- Direct-path recovery is bounded per relay. Losses before five minutes use
  jittered exponential backoff; the third rapid loss opens a circuit for the
  current user connection, so fresh discovery still runs but that relay is
  reached through RelayHub. A real physical-network outage does not increment the
  breaker, and an explicit connect/disconnect resets it.
- `ProxyEngineFactory` returns a `StubProxyEngine` (throws "engine not linked")
  when libbox is absent at runtime — compile-time guarded the same way the
  original handles a missing AAR (reflection-free: source set always compiled,
  AAR always present locally; the stub protects CI checkouts without the AAR —
  see build.gradle comment).

## 7. iOS native

The project is regenerated by **xcodegen** from `ios/project.yml` (replicating
the RN template app target: Start Packager + Bundle React Native code build
phases, ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING=NO, current pbxproj settings), plus the
`PacketTunnel` app-extension target. `scripts/generate-project.sh` runs
`xcodegen generate` + `pod install`. Podfile target stays `OpenRung`.

- `ios/PacketTunnel/` — ported verbatim from production
  (`PacketTunnelProvider.swift`, `PacketTunnelProxyEngine.swift`,
  `LibboxPacketTunnelPlatformInterface.swift`, `EngineDirectories.swift`,
  Info.plist, entitlements) with the §2 identifiers substituted.
- `ios/Shared/` — ported `Shared/` + the OpenRungKit sources the tunnel and
  module need (BrokerClient, RelayDescriptor, RelaySelector, SingBoxConfiguration,
  GeoIpClient, CountryGeo, RelayReachability, InternetProbe, Telemetry*,
  ActivityLog, ConnectionStatus/Snapshot, SharedConnectionState, AppConfig …)
  flattened into one directory compiled into BOTH targets (no SPM package).
- `ios/Shared/WssTicketClient.swift` and `WssFallbackPolicy.swift` implement
  the shared §6 ticket and direct-first classification contract. PacketTunnel
  owns `WssNativeClient.swift`, the exact-front validator, and
  `PhysicalNetworkEpochMonitor.swift`: adapter loss, the health-failure
  threshold, or a changed `NWPath` fingerprint stops Reality before the
  adapter, then performs fresh signed discovery, direct Reality first, and a
  fresh ticket only if another eligible remote failure occurs. An identical
  `NWPath` callback is ignored, and wake only resumes the engine; neither event
  alone retires a healthy WSS session.
- `ios/OpenRung/OpenRungVpnModule.swift` + `OpenRungVpnModule.m`
  (RCT_EXTERN_MODULE) — implements §3 over NETunnelProviderManager +
  SharedConnectionState (Darwin observer + NEVPNStatusDidChange), including the
  production relay-switch dance (stop → 350 ms → reconfigure → start).
- Both targets: packet-tunnel-provider entitlement + app group; no ATS exceptions —
  default App Transport Security is enforced because every production endpoint
  is HTTPS (see ARCHITECTURE.md § "Network transport"). PacketTunnel links `ThirdParty/Libbox.xcframework`
  (embed:false) + libresolv.tbd, `APPLICATION_EXTENSION_API_ONLY=YES`; compiles
  without the xcframework via the existing `#if canImport(Libbox)` stub.
- `ios/build-libbox-release.sh` generates that one device+simulator
  `Libbox.xcframework` by grafting only `wss_binding.go` into the pinned sing-box
  libbox package and resolving wsscore v0.2.0 from
  `android/punchbridge/go.mod`. PacketTunnel calls the generated
  `LibboxNewOpenRungWSSClientForIOS(frontURL,ticket,listener)` export, whose
  nil `SocketProtector` deliberately selects wsscore's Apple nil-protector
  path. A second gomobile framework/runtime or an artifact built with
  `WSSCORE_SRC` is not releasable.

## 8. Known prototype limitations (documented in README)

- Speed test TTFB/throughput measured via whole-body fetch (no streaming).
- In-app language switch does not relayout RTL (fa/ar) without app restart.
- iOS simulator: UI + map + directory work; connect fails by design
  (NetworkExtension requires a signed device build).
- iOS does not yet consume the optional punch metadata and uses RelayHub for
  volunteer-run tunnel-transport relays.
- Telemetry from TS covers only speed-test events; the native connect path keeps
  production telemetry except that `application_connection` is reduced client-side:
  DNS flows are skipped; destination ip/port/protocol and client
  geo/device/network attributes are never sent; and repeated flows normally collapse
  into one event per application per 15 minutes carrying a `connection_count` flow
  total. Totals above 100,000 are split without discarding the remainder and sent in
  separate per-app HTTP-batch budgets, with the still-suppressed tail flushed atomically
  when the session ends or is replaced (relay switch) so the broker's summed rollup
  stays accurate within the existing bounded-outbox and at-least-once-delivery limits.
- License: GPL-3.0-or-later (statically links sing-box), same as production.
